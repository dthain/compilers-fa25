## Homework 2

**Problem 1:** Convert these REs into NFA's using Thompson's construction.  Avoid taking "shortcuts".

- (a) `for | [a-z]+ | [xb]?[0-9]+`
- (b) `a ( bc*d | ed ) d+`
- (c) `( a*b | b*a | ba ) *`

**Problem 2:** Convert the NFAs in the previous problem into DFAs using the subset construction method.

- (a) from above
- (b) from above
- (c) from above

**Problem 3:** Consider how Thompson's construction would be implemented in code instead of a sketch.

Suppose that each NFA is represented by an object A with the following properties: `A[s,i]` is the transition matrix yielding the next integer state(s) given current state `s` and input `i`; `A.start` is the integer start state of the NFA; `A.accept` is the integer accepting state of the NFA; `A.states` is the number of states in the NFA.

- (a) Write out the transition matrix `A` representing the NFA generated by `(a|bc)`, and give the values for `A.start`, `A.accept`, and `A.states`.
- (b) Write out the transition matrix `B` representing `A*`, along with `B.start`, `B.accept`, `B.states`.
- (c) Write some Python-like pseudocode describing how to apply the Kleene closure to any arbitrary NFA `X`.
